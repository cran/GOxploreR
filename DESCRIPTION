Description: It provides an effective, efficient, and fast way to explore the Gene Ontology (GO). 
             Given a set of genes, the package contains functions to assess the GO and obtain the 
             terms associated with the genes and the levels of the GO terms. The package provides 
             functions for the three different GO ontology. We discussed the methods explicitly in 
             the following article <doi:10.1038/s41598-020-73326-3>.
